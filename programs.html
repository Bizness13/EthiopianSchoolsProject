        <strong>Built on a legacy:</strong> Our work is inspired by early community-led efforts (including the 2002 Armania School project) that combined classrooms, learning materials, and essential health/first-aid support to help students thrive.
      </div>
      <p class="lead">Our work centers on elementary literacy, safe learning spaces, and removing barriers so students can succeed.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">1) Reading &amp; Writing Essentials</h2>
          <p>We supply textbooks, workbooks, pencils, paper, and educational materials aligned with Ethiopian elementary curriculum standards. Our focus is on Amharic and English literacy materials for grades 1-8, ensuring students have the tools they need to develop strong reading and writing skills.</p>
          <p class="small"><strong>Who it helps:</strong> Elementary students in rural schools with limited access to books and supplies.</p>
          <p class="small"><strong>Impact metrics:</strong> Number of students receiving materials, number of books distributed, schools supplied.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" style="grid-column: span 12;">
          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">2) Building Learning Spaces</h2>
          <p>We construct new classrooms, library buildings, and essential infrastructure in communities where school facilities are inadequate or non-existent. Projects include classroom construction, library spaces, clean water systems, latrines, and solar lighting. Each project is designed with community input and built to serve students for decades.</p>
          <p class="small"><strong>Project workflow:</strong> Community needs assessment → Design with local input → Construction with local labor → Community celebration and handover → Ongoing maintenance support.</p>
          <p class="small"><strong>Impact metrics:</strong> Number of classrooms built, schools constructed, students served by new facilities.</p>

        <div class="card" style="grid-column: span 12;">
          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">3) Removing Barriers to Learning</h2>
          <p>We help students stay in school and succeed by covering costs that families cannot afford. This includes school uniforms, enrollment fees, supplementary tutoring in reading and writing, and support for school meal programs. Our goal is to ensure that financial barriers don&#x27;t prevent children from accessing education.</p>
          <p class="small"><strong>Who it helps:</strong> Students from low-income families in rural communities.</p>
          <p class="small"><strong>Support types:</strong> Uniforms, fees, tutoring, meals, mentorship.</p>
          <p class="small"><strong>Impact metrics:</strong> Number of students supported, retention rates, literacy improvement.</p>
