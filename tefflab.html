  <h2>About Sasu</h2>
  <p>
    From a young age, Sasu’s parents instilled in him a deep love for Ethiopian heritage, community,
    and learning. Family, culture, and curiosity shaped the foundation of his life.
    Childhood moments—being read to by his parents, exploring food and farming, and asking
    thoughtful questions—became seeds for a lifelong mission.

          Experiences like time spent in fields and farms sparked Sasu’s fascination with agriculture,

  <h2>From Vision to TeffLab</h2>
  <p>
    While studying and later presenting his ideas at NYU, Sasu envisioned a social enterprise rooted
    in Ethiopian teff—the iron-rich supergrain. TeffLab was born as both an innovation lab and a
    vehicle for impact.

          TeffBar became TeffLab’s flagship product—crafted, sold at farmers markets and pop-ups,
          and designed to be both nourishing and purposeful.
